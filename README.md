# FlashProject


As of yet, unknown as to what the end result of this will be. Likely, it will be "akin to" a flash player, with some corners cut wherever I see fit.

Currently, I have something that should be capable of separating the basic datatypes used to make the tags used in the swf format into structs. The next step would be to create classes for the tags, as well as tokenizing the data.
